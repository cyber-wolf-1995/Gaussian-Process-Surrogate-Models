# Gaussian-Process-Surrogate-Models

Description: This work contains MATLAB and Python programs based on Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (MATLAB) and Scikitlearn library (Python) to develop surrogate models for Off-road autonomous vehicles.

Instructions:
1. Open MATLAB Folder> Bicylce Model: Run the Simulink Model to generate training data for Gaussian Processes 
2. Save and load the generated data the Generated Data
