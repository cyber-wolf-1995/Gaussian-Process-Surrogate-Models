# Gaussian-Process-Surrogate-Models

Description: This work contains MATLAB and Python programs based on Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (MATLAB) and Scikitlearn library (Python) to develop surrogate models for Off-road autonomous vehicles.

Instructions:

For accessing MATLAB Files:

1. Open MATLAB Folder> Bicylce Model: Run the Simulink Model to generate training data for Gaussian Processes 
2. Save and load the generated data the Generated Data 
3. Run the GPmodel.m file to develop GP Model

Python Files:

Open the specific file in jupyter notebook application you would like to access and run. Eg- "Bicycle Model Normalization.ipynb".

The file 'gp-ddc.ipynb' contains code for fitting a gp-model using F1Tenth-optitrack data.

Files 'train1.mat', 'train2.mat', 'train3.mat', consist of samples for training data.

Files 'test*.mat' where * = 1,2,3.... consist of samples for training data.
